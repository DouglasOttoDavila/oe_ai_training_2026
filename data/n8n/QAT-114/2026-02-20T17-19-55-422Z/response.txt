# Open Questions

1.  **Conflict/Ambiguity: Service Offerings**: The description lists offerings as "strategic planning, program leadership, digital road mapping, generative AI consulting, change management, and customized training, *among others*." AC3 lists "Strategic planning, *Platform evaluations*, Program leadership, Digital road mapping, Generative AI consulting, Change management, Customized training" as key transformation pillars.
    a) Should "Platform evaluations" be included in the list of service offerings on the page, given it's not explicitly in the description's initial list?
    b) Is the list of transformation pillars in AC3 exhaustive, or should other "among others" offerings mentioned in the description also be considered for inclusion?
    *(Impacts: Verify Inclusion of All Specified Transformation Pillars)*
2.  **Definitive CTA Button Texts**: AC6 provides example CTA button texts ("Schedule a Free Consultation" and/or "Request Digital Maturity Assessment"). Are these definitive button texts, or are they placeholders for specific, to-be-determined texts?
    *(Impacts: Verify CTA Button Texts Match Definitive Texts)*
3.  **Specific SEO Keywords**: AC7 states Meta Title, Meta Description, and OG tags should be "optimized for _digital transformation consulting_ keywords". What are the specific keywords to be targeted and used for optimization?
    *(Impacts: Verify Meta Title Presence and Optimization, Verify Meta Description Presence and Optimization, Verify OG Tags Presence and Optimization)*
4.  **Specific CTA Destination URLs**: AC6 states CTAs must link to a "contact form, lead capture module, or calendar booking service." Which specific system(s) and/or URLs should each CTA button link to?
    *(Impacts: Verify All CTAs Link to Correct Destination)*

---

# Assumptions

1.  An existing design system or style guide for Object Edge is in place and will be followed to ensure consistent styling (fonts, colors, spacing).
2.  Standard web UX best practices for content hierarchy, scannability, and comprehension will be applied in the page design.
3.  The CMS provides distinct fields for all specified content elements, including the H1 title, introductory summary, individual transformation pillar titles and descriptions, explainer block title and content, "Digital Maturity Assessment" section content, CTA button labels, CTA destination URLs, Meta Title, Meta Description, and OG Tags.
4.  The "contact form, lead capture module, or calendar booking service" are pre-existing, functional systems that the CTAs will integrate with, and their functionality itself is out of scope for *this* story's testing, though their integration points are in scope.
