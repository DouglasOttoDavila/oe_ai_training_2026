### Open Questions (from Test Inventory)

1.  **Q1: Exhaustive list of transformation pillars.**
    *   **Impact:** Without a definitive and exhaustive list, we cannot fully verify AC5 and FR15. The current tests assume the listed pillars are complete, but additional, unmentioned offerings (implied by "among others") would be missed.
    *   **Action Required:** Clarify the complete and final list of transformation pillars.

2.  **Q2: Exact keywords for SEO optimization.**
    *   **Impact:** We can only test for the *presence* of Meta Title, Meta Description, and OG tags (AC14, FR27). We cannot objectively validate AC14 and FR28 (optimized for _digital transformation consulting_ keywords) without the specific keywords to optimize against.
    *   **Action Required:** Provide the exact keywords/phrases to be used for SEO optimization.

3.  **Q3: Exact CTA button labels.**
    *   **Impact:** AC12 and FR25 specify "e.g.: 'Schedule a Free Consultation' and/or 'Request Digital Maturity Assessment'". We are testing against these examples, but cannot confirm if these are the *exact* final required labels.
    *   **Action Required:** Confirm the precise wording for all CTA button labels.

4.  **Q4: Specific destination for "Schedule a complimentary assessment" CTA.**
    *   **Impact:** While we can verify the CTA links to *a* lead capture mechanism, we cannot validate the *specific* destination for AC13, FR20, and FR26. This limits precise validation of integration.
    *   **Action Required:** Provide the exact URL or specific type of destination for this CTA.

5.  **Q5: Specific requirements for "consistent styling" and "UX flows."**
    *   **Impact:** AC10, AC11, FR22, FR23 ("consistent styling," "UX flows that facilitate easy scanning") are currently subjectively evaluated based on general web design principles. Without explicit design guidelines or mockups, objective validation is limited.
    *   **Action Required:** Provide specific design specifications, style guides, or UX principles/mockups for objective assessment.

6.  **Q6 & Q7: Specific content for "Platform evaluations" and "Customized training" pillars.**
    *   **Impact:** We can confirm the presence of these pillars and a general business value description (AC6, FR16), but cannot validate the *specific content or scope* without further details.
    *   **Action Required:** Provide specific content requirements or examples for the "Platform evaluations" and "Customized training" pillars.

7.  **Q8: Specific content for the introductory summary.**
    *   **Impact:** Similar to pillars, we can confirm the presence and general nature of the introductory summary (AC4, FR14), but without specific content requirements, we cannot validate its exact wording or comprehensive scope.
    *   **Action Required:** Provide more specific content requirements or examples for the introductory summary.

---

### Assumptions (from Test Inventory)

1.  The example provided for the introductory summary (e.g., "a data-driven consultancy that helps enterprises evolve their digital strategies and experience design") serves as a general guide for the type of content expected, rather than a strict mandate for the exact wording.
2.  Unless definitively clarified by Open Question Q1, the list of transformation pillars explicitly mentioned in AC5 and FR15 is considered the exhaustive set for current testing purposes.
3.  For styling and UX (AC10, AC11), tests will rely on visual inspection against the existing main site and adherence to general web best practices, in the absence of explicit design specifications (Q5).
4.  Analytics tagging for CTA clicks (FR30) is expected to trigger standard events (e.g., Google Analytics events) that can be verified via browser developer tools.
