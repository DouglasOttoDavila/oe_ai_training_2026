## Open Questions (carry forward)

1.  **Regarding Service Offerings:** The description lists specific offerings (strategic planning, program leadership, digital road mapping, generative AI consulting, change management, customized training) and states "among others." AC3 provides a definitive list of pillars (Strategic planning, *Platform evaluations*, Program leadership, Digital road mapping, Generative AI consulting, Change management, Customized training). Which list of offerings is definitive for the content on this specific page? Is "Platform evaluations" a required pillar, and are there indeed "others" beyond AC3's list? **(Blocks TC: "Verify all key transformation pillars are listed" and "Verify each pillar has a short description explaining business value")**
2.  **CTA Destination:** Which specific system will CTAs link to (contact form, lead capture module, or calendar booking service)? Are these existing systems or will they need to be developed/integrated? **(Blocks TC: "Verify CTA links to the correct external system (contact form, lead capture, or calendar booking)" and "Verify CTA submission/booking flow is successful")**
3.  **Visual Assets:** What specific hero image/banner is to be used? What is its source or where will it be designed? **(Impacts TC: "Verify a relevant hero image/banner is displayed")**
4.  **Styling Consistency:** Are there specific design guidelines, a design system, or a style guide that defines the "consistent styling with main site (fonts, colors, spacing)"? **(Partially blocks TC: "Verify overall styling consistency with main site" for detailed validation)**
5.  **UX Flows:** Are there specific UX guidelines, wireframes, or mockups that define "UX flows that facilitate easy scanning and comprehension"? **(Partially blocks TC: "Verify UX flows facilitate easy scanning and comprehension" for detailed validation)**
6.  **Analytics Tagging:** What is the specific analytics platform (e.g., Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics) and what specific data points or events need to be tagged for CTA clicks? **(Blocks TC: "Verify CTA click events are correctly tagged and tracked in analytics" - *Note: This TC was in the inventory but not generated as a TestRail case due to being fully blocked, but is relevant here as an Open Question.*)**
7.  **Designer Sign-off:** What is the timeline and process for "Designer sign-off on visual assets"? Which specific designer/team is responsible?

## Assumptions (carry forward)

1.  The "Services > Digital Transformation" navigation described in the story is implemented via the "Services" dropdown in the global top navigation as specified in AC1.
2.  The "Service title shown on the site" (AC2) refers to "Digital Transformation Consulting".
3.  The example content for the introductory summary (e.g., "a data-driven consultancy that helps enterprises evolve their digital strategies and experience design") is indicative of the *type* of content expected, rather than verbatim text. The actual content should reflect similar intent and quality.
4.  The systems linked by CTAs (contact form, lead capture module, or calendar booking service) will be functional and available for testing integration once their specific identity is confirmed.
