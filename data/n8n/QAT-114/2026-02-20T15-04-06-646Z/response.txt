# Open Questions (carry forward)

2.  **Q4:** Are there specific keywords required for the Meta Title, Meta Description, and OG tags optimization beyond the general "digital transformation consulting" keywords? (Blocks `Verify Meta Title Presence and Keywords`, `Verify Meta Description Presence and Keywords`, `Verify OG Tags Presence and Keywords` from full definition)
3.  **Q5:** Which specific system (contact form, lead capture module, or calendar booking service) should the CTAs link to? (Blocks `Verify All CTAs Link to Correct Target Service` from full definition)

# Assumptions (carry forward)
1.  Consistent styling (AC5) refers to adhering to Object Edge's existing brand guidelines and design system.
2.  "Designer sign-off on visual assets" implies that design specifications and assets will be provided by a designer, and the test team will use these as a reference for visual validation.
3.  The content provided for the introductory summary, pillar descriptions, and "What Is Digital Transformation?" explainer block will align with the business rules of supporting lead generation and customer understanding for enterprise B2B and B2C clients (FR8, FR9). Testers will validate presence and general relevance, but deep content accuracy will require content owner sign-off.
4.  The "UX flows that facilitate easy scanning and comprehension" (AC5, FR22) will be assessed subjectively based on general web usability best practices and any explicit design guidelines provided.
5.  Verification of "content accuracy" for blocks like "What Is Digital Transformation?" and pillar descriptions is subjective and will rely on the tester's interpretation against the requirement, ideally supplemented by content owner review.
6.  The "Service title shown on the site" (for AC2/FR11 comparison) refers to an existing or defined standard title for the service across the site, external to this specific page's H1. This implies a source of truth for service titles.
7.  Analytics tagging details (event names, parameters) will be provided by the analytics team for verification.
