# Assumptions

1.  The "current offerings listed on the website" mentioned in the description are accurately captured and potentially refined by the explicit list in AC3 for "key transformation pillars."
2.  Styling consistency (fonts, colors, spacing) is based on the current Object Edge main website design and can be visually verified against existing pages.
3.  The "global top navigation (header)" is present and visible on all pages.
4.  The "main site" refers to the general styling and layout of objectedge.com when assessing consistency.
